# Health-Insurance-Cost-Estimation

The Health Insurance Cost Estimation project aims to predict the cost of health insurance based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoking habits, and region. The project uses machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for insurance costs. The dataset is collected, cleaned, and pre-processed to handle missing values and encode categorical features. The features include attributes like age, sex, BMI, the number of children, smoker status, and region, while the target variable is the insurance cost.

The project applies Linear Regression to train a model using the training data and then evaluates its performance using the R-squared metric. After training, the model predicts insurance costs on test data and new user inputs. The goal is to provide a reliable system that estimates health insurance costs based on user input, helping users understand potential insurance expenses.
